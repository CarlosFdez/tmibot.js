# TMIBot.js

A javascript library that wraps over [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js) to support bot commands.

## Why a new library
TMI.js is barebones, and does not support command parsing. So I wrote a command parser and decided to share it.

Some ideas came from various discord.py bot libraries.
